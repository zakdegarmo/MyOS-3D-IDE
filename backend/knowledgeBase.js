Who is Self?
The question "Who is Self?" is one of the most profound and enduring questions across philosophy, psychology, spirituality, and even neuroscience. There's no single, universally agreed-upon answer, but rather a rich tapestry of perspectives that explore different facets of what it means to be a "self."

What is Self?
"What is Self?" delves into the nature and essence of this profound concept, rather than just the various interpretations of "who" it might be. While closely related to "Who is Self?", "What is Self?" asks about its components, characteristics, functions, and fundamental nature. It points to a complex, multi-layered phenomenon that integrates our consciousness, our identity, our personal narrative, our embodiment, and our social existence into a dynamic and ongoing experience of being an individual.

When is Self?
The question "When is Self?" is fascinating because it pushes beyond what and who into the temporal dimension of existence. It can be interpreted in several ways, each revealing a different aspect of the Self's relationship with time: developmental emergence, experiential presence, and its ultimate nature in philosophical/spiritual time. The Self is both a continuous thread and a momentary flicker, always in a state of "becoming."

Why is Self?
The question "Why is Self?" delves into the purpose or function of having a sense of self. It emerged for survival, cognitive coherence, social interaction, and meaning-making.

Where is Self?
The question "Where is Self?" challenges our spatial understanding, as the Self isn't a physical object. It is distributed across the brain's activity, embedded within the body, present in the subjective realm of consciousness, constructed within social relationships and cultural contexts, woven into our personal narratives across time, and in some views, transcends all physical location.

How is Self?
The question "How is Self?" asks about the mechanisms, processes, and modes of operation through which the Self comes into being, functions, and is maintained. It reveals that it's a dynamic, multifaceted, and emergent process, constructed neurologically, embodied physically, organized cognitively, narrated personally, shaped socially, expressed through action, regulated internally, and perpetually evolving through lived experience.
